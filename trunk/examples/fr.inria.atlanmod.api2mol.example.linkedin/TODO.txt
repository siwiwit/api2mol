TODO LinkedIn example:
- get metamodel and mapping
	- create project and files
		- copy log/log.ecore into project
			=> should not be necessary
		- put API classes in api/
			=> should not be necessary (traversing the jar file should do the trick)
		- create discovererConfiguration in bootstrap/
		- write Reflect class
			- modify paths appropriately
		- launch Reflect class
			=> this creates the Reflect model in bootstrap/
		- transform Reflect model into metamodel + mapping using api2mol.transformations
			=> this should be automated
- test an injection

TODO API2MoL:
- read class list directly from jar instead of from source


QUESTIONS:
- collectJavaClassesFromDisk seems to collect .java files, whereas Twitter example has only .class files
