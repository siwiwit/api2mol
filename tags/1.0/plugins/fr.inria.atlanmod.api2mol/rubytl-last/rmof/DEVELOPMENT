= RMOF development instructions

== Using source code from the repository

See http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=1123 for instructions on how to checkout RMOF's source code.

Before running your development RMOF version (e.g. running the tests), you need
to run:

 rake config

== Running the tests

Every time you make a change to the code, you _need_ to run the tests to make
sure you didn't break anything.

Every time you add a feature, add one or more tests that stress it. Better: add
tests _before_ you ever implement the feature.

Adding tests is a very important activity important so that when anyone else
(or even yourself) changes the implementation in a way that breaks the feature,
running the tests will expose the breakage before it reaches end users.

To run RMOF's tests, you just need to run:

  rake test

== Releasing

Releasing a version includes generating the distribution files and making them
available at RubyForge.

To generate the files for release, run <tt>rake release</tt>. This will
generate a tarball that can be distributed.

If you just want to generate the tarball, it's sufficient to run <tt>rake
package</tt>.
